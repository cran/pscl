0.60    * added postProcess
           * added jitter to plot.predict.ideal
           * changed "start" to "burnin" in many function that handle ideal objects
	   * changed checkStart to checkBurnIn in idealHelper.r,
           returns "keep"  (logical vector)
	   * improved documentation for plot1d
	   * dropped plot1d and plot2d from export in NAMESPACE 
           * consolidated some help files, making fewer entries in
           package index etc
	   * checked package with codetools(), cleaned up some
	   redundancies, overwriting of function args inside of
	   functions etc
	   * minor stylistic changes to titles and descriptions in
	   help files

	removed unneeded directories

0.58 documentaton fixes and cleanups, prompted by Kurt Hornik's check of 0.57 at CRAN
     fixed errors in rollcall documentation

0.57 added dtl file support to readKH
        extensive reliance on match.call(), rather than carrying around copies of objects, many changes to numerous functions
        dropList introduced, many functions changed; see dropRollCall and dropUnanimous (rollcall objects)
        added extractRollCallObject (for ideal objects)
	added computeMargins, for rollcall objects
	added convertCodes, operates on codes component of roll call object
        tracex handles 2d traces gracefully
        added plot.predict.ideal
        prior precisions in constrain.legis and contstrain.item are .01 for unconstrained parameters
        added s109, dropped s102 as demonstration data, ships with package
        added vectorRepresentation (rollcall object)

0.56 changed rollcall class to have legis.data and vote.data data frames
        amended plotting functions appropriately
        rollcall objects have party loyalty scores
        rollcall objects have lopsided data; summary.rollcall/print.summary.rollcall will display
        ideal saves some barebones summary statistics (posterior means)
        summary.ideal computes standard deviations
        summary.ideal/print.summary.ideal displays information on bills that fail to discriminate 
        plot1d (plot method for 1d ideal objects) has option for all legislator names
        plot2d (plot method for 2d ideal objects) has option to overlay estimated cutting lines
        added readKH function and supporting data objects in R/sysdata.rda (state.info and party)
        readKH has extensive checks and debugging of reads from web (thanks to Kurt Kornik <Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at>)
        minor bug fixes in documentation and examples
        made ideal examples shorter
        add coda to list of required packages
        error in negative binomial hurdle model, added theta to coefficients dimnames 
        added TODO file to top-level directory of package
        fixed bug in print.zeroinfl (thanks to Bettina Grün <gruen@ci.tuwien.ac.at>)
	bugs in zeroinfl (Bettina Grün <gruen@ci.tuwien.ac.at>)
        corrected spelling of Ginsb*u*rg in sc9497 (Supreme Court sample data)

0.55 added ideal point estimation (Alex Tahk)
        added gamma functions for Jackman BASS book

0.54 fixed errors in documentation for summary.zeroinfl

0.53 edited documentation for odTest

0.52	changed print.matrix references to print, since print.matrix
	depreacted in R > 2.1
	added ntable from Jim Fearon
	added betaHPD

0.51	fixed error in print.summary.zeroinfl (thanks to Dave Atkins; 
	datkins@fuller.edu)


0.5	initial relase to CRAN
