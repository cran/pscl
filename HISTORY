1.03 * bug in ideal start value argument processing thanks to Bjorn Hoyland

1.02 * added politicalInformation data
     * added MDA option to ideal

1.01 * added EfronMorris data
     * added RockTheVote data
 
1.00 * updated CITATION and docs to version 1.00 accompanying JSS paper

0.97 * minor changes to print and summary methods for rollcall and ideal objects
     * bugs in ideal (discovered via odd combination of store.item and file) 
     * dropRollCallObject makes prettier output, works a little more sanely
     * s109 is now updated to its final status, example points to voteview.com
     * s110 in examples for readKH
     * adding component named "dropInfo" to rollcall objects produced by
       dropRollCall, per request of Keith Poole (this stores information about
       which legislators/votes are retained by dropRollCall)
     * added presidentialElections data from Jackman book manuscript
     * bugs in igammaHDR fixed, some typos too 

0.96 * Final changes for JSS paper (before release 1.0 accompanying
       JSS paper).
     * Changed the default formula specification for zero-inflated
       models. y ~ x now means y ~ x | x and *not* y ~ x | 1 anymore.
       Thus, the same default formula processing is applied to
       zero-inflated and hurdle models.
     * Error in normalizeIdeal, found by Jeff Lewis

0.95 * fixed fitted() and predict() methods for "hurdle" and
       "zeroinfl" for the case when an offset is specified
       (this had been erroneously ignored previously)

0.94 * added analytical gradients for hurdle() and zeroinfl()
       (speed-up of factor 5-10)
     * new package "sandwich" (2.1-0) provides estfun() and bread()
       methods for "hurdle" and "zeroinfl" objects, thus sandwich()
       and vcovOPG() covariances are available
     * extended/improved countreg vignette
     * fixed Pearson residuals to use correct zero-augmented
       variance
     * extended predict() methods: type "count" and "zero"
     * added extractAIC() methods

0.93 * improving matching legislator and vote names in constrain
       functions, in response to sub-optimal behavior reported by Keith Poole
  
0.92 * minor errors in various functions spotted with
       stricter code checking in R-devel 2.6
     * unescaped "%" in documentation for s109
     * need negative 1 for negative intercept in 
       another part of predict.ideal (for the case where the researcher
       did not supply burn-in; 05/15/2007).

0.91 * added Monte Carlo simulation of pi (simpi)

0.90 * version bump as requested by Achim
     * adding pseudo r-squared stuff
     * adding admit data for ordered probit example
     * adding logLik.polr
     * adding hitmiss method

0.76 * offset and weights arguments have been added to
       zeroinfl() and hurdle()
     * hurdletest() is a new wrapper for linear.hypothesis()
       from the "car" package to test for the presence of
       hurdles.
     * A vignette about count data regression in R has been
       added (which in particular explains the ideas behind
       zeroinfl() and hurdle()).
     * correcting/improving documentation of ideal re identification and the normalize option
     * added absentee ballot data from Orley Ashenfelter, used in
       BASS
       * John Fox noted an error in odTest (wrong p-value); fixed.

0.75 * version bump, requested by CRAN maintainers 
     * minor typo in help for predict.ideal
     * fixed bugs with interactive() in ideal.r
     * trouble-shooting predict.ideal as per request of
       Boris Shor
     * bug (?) in predict.ideal; after 0.73 change to
       negative intercept, need change in predict.ideal.r to match
     * in zeroinfl(): binomial(link = link) is deprecated, use
       binomial(link = linkstr) instead

0.74 * deprecating meanzero option in ideal, replace with normalize
     * new options for specifying start values in ideal (eigen, random, or user-supplied list);
       this fixes a bug reported by Boris Shor <boris@bshor.com> when working with 
       large rollcall objects
     * removed bad escape "\," in readKH 
       reported by Kurt Hornick <Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at> 
     * dummy entry to force svn commit/update (testing new svn server)

0.73 * added seatsVote class and ca2006 data
     * cleaned up startvalues processing in ideal
     * improved priors in ideal
     * added verbose option to ideal
     * less console output from ideal.c
     * some changes to documentation, e.g., postProcess gets extra references
     * sort output by posterior means of ideal points in summary.ideal
     * improved tracex
     * fixed bug in dropRollCall (was dropping legis.data attributes)
     * fixed bug in partyLoyalty, called by summary.rollcall(...,verbose=TRUE)
     * finally changed ideal model to have a negative intercept; required changes to 
       updatex.c, updatey.c, and xreg.c

0.72 * fixed error in bioChemists data found by Bettina Grün
       <gruen@ci.tuwien.ac.at>, variable kids5 was off by 1 unit, now runs
       from min of zero (no kids).

0.71 * fixed bug in betaHPD discovered by John Bullock
    
0.70 * completely rewritten version of hurdle() and zeroinfl():
     	 - new formula interface of type y ~ x | z where y ~ x
     	   specifies the count model and z the inflation/hurdle
     	   regressors.
     	 - re-structured returned value, is now more similar to
     	   "glm" objects
     	 - extended/enhanced extractor functions

0.62 * plot.ideal.1d: better left plot margin, based on max length of
       legis.name
     * plot.ideal.2d: inconsistent testing of presence of beta in ideal object
       when overlaying cutting planes
       * plot.ideal.Rd: more examples (but in \dontrun)
     * tracex: bug for 2d ideal objects
     * tracex: 2d, make legend lines heavier for showAll
     * tracex: for R >= 2.4, change par() to par(no.readonly=TRUE) 
     * fixed typo in plot.ideal.Rd

0.61 * fixed bug in summary.ideal found by Keith Poole (8/8/06)
     * documentation of ideal section on Identification changed
       to reflect presence of postProcess function
     * added summary.rollcall into NAMESPACE per request of Jeff
       Lewis
     * no nsl function on Windows, changed readKH to simply call
       readLines with a try-error wrapper per suggestion of
       XP-user Jeff Lewis
     * processing of dropList improved, per suggestion of Jeff
       Lewis
     * cosmetic changes to print.summary.rollcall
     * fixed errors caused by removing sysdata.rda; now utility
       data sets such as stateinfo and partyinfo have to loaded
       via data() in functions inside readKH subfunctions; again,
       Jeff Lewis reported error testing readKH function. 

0.60 * added postProcess
     * added jitter to plot.predict.ideal
     * changed "start" to "burnin" in many function that handle ideal objects
     * changed checkStart to checkBurnIn in idealHelper.r,
       returns "keep"  (logical vector)
     * improved documentation for plot1d
     * dropped plot1d and plot2d from export in NAMESPACE 
     * consolidated some help files, making fewer entries in
       package index etc
     * checked package with codetools(), cleaned up some
       redundancies, overwriting of function args inside of
       functions etc
     * minor stylistic changes to titles and descriptions in
       help files
