0.75		* version bump, requested by CRAN maintainers 
		* minor typo in help for predict.ideal
		* fixed bugs with interactive() in ideal.r
		* trouble-shooting predict.ideal as per request of
		Boris Shor
		* bug (?) in predict.ideal; after 0.73 change to
		negative intercept, need change in predict.ideal.r to match
		* in zeroinfl(): binomial(link = link) is deprecated, use
		  	binomial(link = linkstr) instead

0.74		* deprecating meanzero option in ideal, replace with normalize
		* new options for specifying start values in ideal (eigen, random, or user-supplied list);
			this fixes a bug reported by Boris Shor <boris@bshor.com> when working with 
			large rollcall objects
		* removed bad escape "\," in readKH 
			reported by Kurt Hornick <Kurt.Hornik@wu-wien.ac.at> 
		* dummy entry to force svn commit/update (testing new svn server)

0.73		* added seatsVote class and ca2006 data
		* cleaned up startvalues processing in ideal
		* improved priors in ideal
		* added verbose option to ideal
		* less console output from ideal.c
		* some changes to documentation, e.g., postProcess gets extra references
		* sort output by posterior means of ideal points in summary.ideal
		* improved tracex
		* fixed bug in dropRollCall (was dropping legis.data attributes)
		* fixed bug in partyLoyalty, called by summary.rollcall(...,verbose=TRUE)
		* finally changed ideal model to have a negative intercept; required changes to 
			updatex.c, updatey.c, and xreg.c

0.72     * fixed error in bioChemists data found by Bettina Grün
  	 <gruen@ci.tuwien.ac.at>, variable kids5 was off by 1 unit, now runs
  	 from min of zero (no kids).

0.71     * fixed bug in betaHPD discovered by John Bullock
    
0.70     * completely rewritten version of hurdle() and zeroinfl():
             - new formula interface of type y ~ x | z where y ~ x
	       specifies the count model and z the inflation/hurdle
	       regressors.
	     - re-structured returned value, is now more similar to
	       "glm" objects
	     - extended/enhanced extractor functions

0.62    * plot.ideal.1d: better left plot margin, based on max length of
 	 legis.name
	 * plot.ideal.2d: inconsistent testing of presence of beta in ideal object
 	   when overlaying cutting planes
	   * plot.ideal.Rd: more examples (but in \dontrun)
	 * tracex: bug for 2d ideal objects
	 * tracex: 2d, make legend lines heavier for showAll
	 * tracex: for R >= 2.4, change par() to par(no.readonly=TRUE) 
	 * fixed typo in plot.ideal.Rd

0.61	   * fixed bug in summary.ideal found by Keith Poole (8/8/06)
           * documentation of ideal section on Identification changed
	   to reflect presence of postProcess function
	   * added summary.rollcall into NAMESPACE per request of Jeff
	   Lewis
	   * no nsl function on Windows, changed readKH to simply call
	   readLines with a try-error wrapper per suggestion of
	   XP-user Jeff Lewis
           * processing of dropList improved, per suggestion of Jeff
	   Lewis
           * cosmetic changes to print.summary.rollcall
	   * fixed errors caused by removing sysdata.rda; now utility
	   data sets such as stateinfo and partyinfo have to loaded
	   via data() in functions inside readKH subfunctions; again,
	   Jeff Lewis reported error testing readKH function. 

0.60    * added postProcess
           * added jitter to plot.predict.ideal
           * changed "start" to "burnin" in many function that handle ideal objects
	   * changed checkStart to checkBurnIn in idealHelper.r,
           returns "keep"  (logical vector)
	   * improved documentation for plot1d
	   * dropped plot1d and plot2d from export in NAMESPACE 
           * consolidated some help files, making fewer entries in
           package index etc
	   * checked package with codetools(), cleaned up some
	   redundancies, overwriting of function args inside of
	   functions etc
	   * minor stylistic changes to titles and descriptions in
	   help files

        rollcall objects have party loyalty scores

        ideal saves some barebones summary statistics (posterior means)
        summary.ideal computes standard deviations
        summary.ideal/print.summary.ideal displays information on bills that fail to discriminate 
        plot1d (plot method for 1d ideal objects) has option for all legislator names
